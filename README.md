# Windows-InfluxStats
Pipes some windows stats into an InfluxDB.

Its a janky script but its a start if you need to pipe some data into Influx for Grafana.

Requires the Influx module to be installed. https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Influx/1.0.80

Has been tested on Windows Server 2012 R2 and Windows Server 2016 but should also work on Hyper-V Server
